# Content & Image Generator

![](1.png)

**Content & Image Generator** is a powerful Streamlit-based web application that combines cutting-edge language models and image generation technology. It generates dynamic text content using the **Google Generative AI model** and creates images using **Stable Diffusion via the Hugging Face API**. Users can then download both the generated content and images as a DOCX file for convenience.

## Key Features

- **Content Generation with Google AI**: Uses the Google Generative AI model to automatically generate text based on user-defined parameters like topic, tone, style, audience, and purpose.
- **AI-Driven Image Generation with Hugging Face**: Leverages the Stable Diffusion model from Hugging Face to generate images that complement the generated contentâ€™s topic and style.
- **DOCX Export**: Combines generated content and images into a downloadable DOCX file for easy sharing and use.

## Installation Guide

Ensure Python 3.10 or higher is installed before following these setup steps:

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PriyanshuDey23/ContentImageGenPro.git
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and install all required dependencies:

```bash
cd <project-directory>
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add the following environment variables:

```bash
GOOGLE_API_KEY=<your-google-api-key>
HUGGING_FACE_API_KEY=<your-hugging-face-api-key>
```

Replace `<your-google-api-key>` and `<your-hugging-face-api-key>` with your respective API keys for the **Google Generative AI** and **Hugging Face** services.

### Step 4: Launch the Streamlit App

Run the Streamlit application using the following command:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This command will open the app in your default web browser, where you can begin generating content and images.
